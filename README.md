# Summary
- Three balls in play at once, played with either four or three people (two is way too difficult for mere mortals).
- Used at IBM Hursley in G Block by the Node.js team.

# Objective
All three balls must be in the opponent's goal at once: then you win.

# Rules
- Games are started by placing the balls in each serving hole and in the middle: a countdown of "three, two, one" is started and then the balls are served into the middle, hitting the central ball.
- Serving can be done at any time from the goal once scored, the ball can be placed anywhere including thrown in: but it must hit a player first in order for a goal to count should the ball go in to the goal.
- If the ball leaves the table at any time (by either hitting the ball or by serving), the one who did it must go and recover the ball while the game still goes on.
- If the ball is stuck, anyone is free to use their hand to "enter the lion's den" and to push it back into play.
